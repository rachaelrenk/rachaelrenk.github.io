## 🧭 Enterprise Onboarding Guide - GitHub Docs

I led the planning and delivery of an onboarding documentation set for GitHub Enterprise customers. Working with content designers, I identified key goals and created a detailed documentation plan informed by user research. I divided the scope of work into smaller units and organized a team-wide “swarm” to draft and review content. I wrote and edited a substantial portion of the conceptual and procedural articles in the guide, and reviewed the final product to ensure alignment with key goals. This work helped remove adoption blockers, allowing customers to self-serve onboarding more quickly and with less friction—reducing the need for support intervention.
