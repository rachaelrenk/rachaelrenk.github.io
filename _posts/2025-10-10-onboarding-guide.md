## 🧭 Enterprise onboarding guide

I led the planning and delivery of a comprehensive onboarding documentation set for GitHub Enterprise Cloud customers. This initiative aimed to help new customers quickly get up and running, with fewer support tickets. I worked with content designers to understand goals and pain points, and shape the overall structure of the docs to logically support the customer journey.

From there, I created a detailed documentation plan, audited existing content for reuse, and organized team-wide "swarms" to draft and review articles. I kept the project running smoothly by leading team syncs, assigning and reviewing work, and making sure every contributor had the clarity and context they needed. I also wrote and edited a substantial portion of the conceptual and procedural articles, then reviewed the final documentation set to ensure it met our goals.

This work removed adoption blockers and enabled customers to self-serve onboarding more quickly and with less friction, reducing the need for support intervention.

## 📑 Artifacts

To illustrate the scale of the project and provide a snapshot of the information architecture, the following screenshot shows the full structure of the onboarding guide. The categories, topics, and the way in which they're organized, are designed to guide users sequentially through their initial set up.
