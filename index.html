title: ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rachael.

<p>
  Iâ€™m a user advocate, communication nerd, and technical writer (among other
  things). I care deeply about human-centered content design, and I love turning
  complexity into clarity.
</p>

<p>
  Over the past 10+ years, Iâ€™ve written accessible documentation for hardware,
  software, and SaaS products; winning technical and business proposals in the
  government sector; and beginner-friendly instructional materials.
</p>

<p>
  I believe great documentation builds trust, saves time, and helps people do
  meaningful work.
</p>

  This portfolio contains writing samples from across technical communication
  genres, and highlights peer feedback from my recent role as Senior Technical
  Writer at GitHub. To see my work history or get in touch, you can
