Where did I come from, and how did I get here?

## The Beginning

I was born in 1991. When I was 6, my family got our first PC: it ran Windows 95 and came with Microsoft Paint and Solitaire. I fastidiously opened and inspected every file, folder, and application on that machine, sometimes moving or editing things to see what would happen (sorry, Mom and Dad). I would explore new programs until I knew all the functions, or until I broke something. Once we got Microsoft Office, I spent hours designing newsletters and websites. There was nowhere to publish my work, but I loved the creation process.

Dial-up internet followed a few years later, and with it, I now had _extremely slow_ access to the whole world: real webistes, email, message boards and IIRC. I loved it all, and every day felt like an opportunity to discover something new. Armed with Notepad, Firefox, a couple library books, and the same "inspect, experiment, break" approach, I taught myself HTML, XHTML, and CSS. I viewed the source code of every interesting website I found, and I built my own sites from scratch. When MySpace came along, I had already been customizing my Xanga skins and LiveJournal themes for years.

At 13, I taught an HTML class to the other kids in my homeschool co-op. That's right, I was homeschooled. I'm an autodidact at heart and always have been.
