Where did I come from, and how did I get here?

## The Beginning

I was born in 1991. When I was 6, my family got our first PC. It came loaded with Windows 95. I fastidiously opened and inspected every file, folder, and application on that machine. I explored new programs until I knew all the functions, or until something broke (sorry, Mom and Dad). Once we got Microsoft Office, I spent hours designing newsletters and websites. There was nowhere to publish my work, but I loved the creation process.

Dial-up internet followed a few years later, and with it, _extremely slow_ access to the rest of the world: email, message boards, IRC, and real websites. Now that I was connected, I wanted to build: equipped with Notepad, Firefox, and library books, I taught myself HTML/XHTML, and later, CSS. I viewed the source code of every interesting website I found, and I coded my own sites from scratch. Then, I organized a class and taught HTML to the other kids in my homeschool co-op. 

Yes, I was homeschooled. I've always been an autodidact - and a bit of an non-conformist.

While math was sometimes a challenge, reading, writing, and comprehension came naturally. I was a book worm, and I loved to write. (One summer, I completed several grade levels of spelling and grammar just for fun. A benefit of homeschooling was that I could work at my own pace.) I realized early on that writing was a powerful way to convey information and share ideas. I myself had learned so much from consuming the written word.

Teaching HTML to my peers was incredibly energizing. I wanted to help people understand and use technology, and I sensed I could do so through writing and tools like the internet. It would be a while longer before I connected my feelings with the field of technical communication, but I was well on my way.
