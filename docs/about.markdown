Where did I come from, and how did I get here?

## The Beginning

I was born in 1991. When I was 6, my family got our first PC. It came loaded with Windows 95. I fastidiously opened and inspected every file, folder, and application on that machine, sometimes moving or editing things to see what would happen (sorry, Mom and Dad). I explored new programs until I knew all the functions, or until something broke. Once we got Microsoft Office, I spent hours designing newsletters and websites. There was nowhere to publish my work, but I loved the creation process.

Dial-up internet followed a few years later, and with it, _extremely slow_ access to the rest of the world: real websites, email, message boards, and IRC. Equipped with Notepad, Firefox, and library books, I taught myself HTML/XHTML and CSS. I viewed the source code of every interesting website I found, and I built my own sites from scratch. Then, I organized a class and taught HTML to the other kids in my homeschool co-op. Yes, I was homeschooled. I'm an autodidact at heart and always have been. 

If I wasn't reading something on the computer, then my nose was in a book. And when I wasn't reading, I was writing. Be it journal entries, stories, poems, or the content for all those websites I built. When asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, I often said "author". I recognized early on that writing was a powerful way to convey information and shape thoughts. It seemed to me, computers and the internet were the best way to share that writing with the world.

So you see, technology and language have been very intertwined in my life since the start.
