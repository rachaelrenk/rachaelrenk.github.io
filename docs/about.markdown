Where did I come from, and how did I get here?

## The Beginning

I was born in 1991. When I was 6, my family got our first PC. It came loaded with Windows 95. I fastidiously opened and inspected every file, folder, and application on that machine. I explored new programs until I knew all the functions, or until something broke (sorry, Mom and Dad). Once we got Microsoft Office, I spent hours designing newsletters and websites. There was nowhere to publish my work, but I loved the creation process.

Dial-up internet followed a few years later, and with it, _extremely slow_ access to the rest of the world: real websites, email, message boards, and IRC. Equipped with Notepad, Firefox, and library books, I taught myself HTML/XHTML and CSS. I viewed the source code of every interesting website I found, and I built my own sites from scratch. Then, I organized a class and taught HTML to the other kids in my homeschool co-op. 

Yes, I was homeschooled. I've always been an autodidact - and a bit of an non-conformist.

While math was sometimes a challenge, reading, writing, and comprehension came naturally. I was a book worm, and I loved to write. I finished several grade levels of spelling and grammar in a matter of months, just because I could (one of the benefits of homeschooling: ability to work at my own pace.) I realized early on that writing was a powerful way to convey information and shape thoughts. I learned so much from consuming the written word, and I had a feeling I could help others learn, too. 

It seemed to me, computers and the internet were excellent tools to share that writing with the world.
