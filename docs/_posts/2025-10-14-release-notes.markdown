## GHES Release Notes â€“ GitHub

I owned release notes for all GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) major and patch version releases as Directly Responsible Individual (DRI). I organized a rotation of technical writers to manage each cycle, while I personally led publication of release notes for the GHES 3.16 release.

#### Context

Each GHES release involved close collaboration with PMs, TPMs, and engineers to communicate new and updated features, fixes, and breaking changes for enterprise administrators and developers. For the 3.16 release, I led coordination across globally distributed teams to ensure accuracy, consistency, and timely delivery within GitHubâ€™s docs-as-code publishing workflow.

**Role:** Technical Writer, DRI

**Date:** 2024-2025

**Activities:**

* Planned and managed crelease notes workflow for GHES 3.16, from information gathering to publication
* Partnered with product managers and engineers to validate technical accuracy and ensure alignment across teams
* Authored, edited, and standardized release notes, prioritizing clarity and user needs
* Collaborated with the Releases team to address blockers and improve workflow efficiency
* Supported projects to introduce lightweight automations and AI-assisted tooling to streamline content gathering and review.
