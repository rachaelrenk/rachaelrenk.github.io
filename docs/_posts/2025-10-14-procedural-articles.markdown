## Setting Up and Ending a Trial of GitHub Enterprise - Gitub

I researched and authored two procedural articles to help administrators confidently set up a new trial and later convert or cancel it. Together, these articles support a key phase of the custoemr onboarding journey by providing clear, accurate guidance for account transitions.

#### Context

These articles were part of the broader [GitHub Enterprise onboarding initiative](enterprise-onboarding-guide.html) aimed at improving customer self-service and reducing reliance on support. Each procedure addressed a complex moment of decision-making, initiating a trial or ending one, requiring a balance of technical accuracy, plain language, and user empathy.
