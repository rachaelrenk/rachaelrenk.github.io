## Enterprise Onboarding Guide - GitHub

I led the creation and delivery of a comprehensive onboarding guide for GitHub Enterprise Cloud customers.

#### Context

The onboarding guide is a structured documentation set composed of categories and topics published on [docs.github.com](https://docs.github.com). It was created to support new GitHub Enterprise Cloud administrators through complex setup and configuration decisions, addressing common pain points and enabling faster, self-serve onboarding with less reliance on support.

**Role:** Technical Writer, Project Lead

**Date:** 2025

**Activities:**

* Partnered with content design to understand existing user research, goals, and painpoints
* Refined structure of the doc set to logically support the customer journey
* Audited existing content for reuse
* Created a documentation plan that detailed what content needed to be created and updated, including an outline of articles and timeline for delivery
* Organized team-wide "swarms" to draft and review articles
* Led team syncs, assigned and reviewed work, and ensured every contributor had the clarity and context they needed
* Wrote and edited a substantial portion of the conceptual and procedural articles
* Reviewed the final documentation set to ensure it met key goals
