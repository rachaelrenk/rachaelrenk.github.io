👋 Hi, I'm Rachael.

I’m a user advocate, communication nerd, and technical writer (among other things). I care deeply about human-centered content design, and I love turning complexity into clarity.

Over the last 10+ years, I’ve written accessible documentation for hardware, software, and SaaS products; winning technical and business proposals in the government sector; beginner-friendly instructional materials; and technical communication curriculum for higher education.

I believe great documentation builds trust, saves time, and helps people do meaningful work.

This portfolio contains writing samples from across technical communication genres. To see my work history or get in touch, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachaelrenk).
