### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rachael.

Iâ€™m a user advocate, communication nerd, and technical writer. I care deeply about human-centered content design and turning complexity into clarity.

Over the last 10+ years, Iâ€™ve written accessible documentation for hardware, software, and SaaS products; winning technical and business proposals in the government sector; beginner-friendly instructional materials; and technical communication curriculum for higher education.

I believe great documentation builds trust, saves time, and helps people do meaningful work.

This portfolio contains work samples from across genres. To see my work history or get in touch, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachaelrenk).
